# Tune Parser

A collection of mini projects related to my iTunes library! Just messing around, so everything a little rough around the edges and everywhere else.

Currently:

- PlayPlotter: Scatter plot of song plays against frequency
- TuneScraper: Lyric scraper from Genius to update USLT tag of songs
- SingleScraper: Command line script to grab lyric data for single song given name/artist variable
