# Tune Parser

A collection of projects of varying size, all related to music files: lyric scraping, iTunes parsing/logging, Twitter lyric bots, and more! Everything is for personal use so a tad rough around the edges (and everywhere else):

- Parser: Script to run through iTunes Library.xml file to load in song data, or query iTunes Library via Swift executable
- Scraper: Lyric scraper from Genius to update lyric tag of all songs specified as having scrapable vocals (Vocal in comments)
- Lyrical: Lyric grabber from random/specified songs
	- LyricBot: Script used to post random lyrics to Twitter for various artist bots, using Genius/Google Doc/Sheets as source
- Logger: Script to read differences in iTunes Library.xml, and log change
