# Tune Parser

A collection of mini projects related to my iTunes library! Just messing around, so everything a little rough around the edges and everywhere else.

Currently:

- TuneScraper: Lyric scraper from Genius to update USLT tag of songs
- Lyrical: Lyric grabber from random or specified song
    - LyricBot: Twitter bot that posts random lyrics for various artists using Genius lyrics or curated Google Doc
- PlayPlotter: Scatter plot of song plays against frequency
